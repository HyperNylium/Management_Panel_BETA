<h1 align="center">This beta version includes</h1>
<h4>
- Minor bug fixes<br>
- New command for `Jarvis`. Saying "Lock my computer" will lock your computer (just like clicking `windows + L` keys but now included with jarvis)<br>
- New error catching method on importing critical libraries<br>
- Optimized `Management_Panel` and `MP_MINI` (some of you were saying that the program was launching in 3 seconds. Well, now it should launch anywere between 400ms - 1.5s)<br>
- Full re-design of `MP_MINI` (Some text was to small and sometimes hard to read. So, i made things a bit bigger and easier to navigate)<br>
- Added "help" command to `Jarvis` (Whenever you say "help", jarvis will show you all of his commands for 5 seconds then go back to take commands)<br>
- Upgraded to "Jarvis play music" function. Should now scan for .mp3 files in your music dir (C:\\Users\\[user]\Music) and list them one by one.<br>
  For example:<br>
    [1] Musicfile1.mp3<br>
    [2] Musicfile2.mp3<br>
    [3] Musicfile3.mp3<br>
    All you need to do is type the number infront of the file name in the given input and wait for your song to launch. If `Jarvis` has any problems, he will let you know and return to taking commands shortly after that.<br>

All of these are currently in progress so don't get to excited. Once all tasks listed above are complete, i will post them [Here](https://github.com/HyperNylium/Management_Panel) and will make the update 3.7.0. All `Updater.exe` files should pick the update up and download it but i highly suggest to download the new version of the `Updater.exe` file once released (i haven't released it yet btw).
